Syntax Error

if 5 > 2:

"""
There was an example about being able to choose my own level of identation and how I must then use that same level there after, but I got into programming during the time where 4 spaces = 1 tab and that also seems to be the default for Python instead of the newly adopted 2 spaces being 1 tab, so instead of exploring that and confusing myself, I will stick to 4 spaces as a tab so as not to confuse myself and get ideas about customising a 'tab' too much.

x = 5

# Comments - Yes, this is weird, as I'm already using comments quite a bit, but I needed to properly document my learnings' with Python and so here we are.

print("Hello, World! This print statement is preceded by a singe line comment.")
