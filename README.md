# Playground

Welcome to the Playground.

This is where I learn and play around with different languages, or if I have random ideas that I don't belong in a project on it's own, I will save into this repository, seperated by folders.

The current plan is to learn Zig. Why? Enough questions! Cuz I can, mostly. Something new and fast and apparently fun. For web technologies, I will be using JavaScript/TypeScript since I can use one language via a Zig built runtime called bun, and it'll keep the amount of languages required to learn at a low number so I can focus on building things, and not getting paralyzed by indecision looking for the best language, etc.
